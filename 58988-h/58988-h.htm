    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The original volume promised many illustrations. However, the edition
used here had none of them.  The List of Illustrations is retained; however,
the pages indicated, which were struck out and corrected with hand-written notes,
were not valid and have been removed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The text was printed with two columns per page, which could not be
reproduced in this format.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Please
see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text
for details regarding the handling of any textual issues encountered
during its preparation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following less-common characters are found in this book: ă
(a with breve), ā (a with macron), ĕ (e with breve), ē (e with macron),
ĭ (i with breve), ī (i with macron), ŏ (o with breve), ō (o with macron),
ŭ (u with breve), ū (u with macron). If they
do not display properly, please try changing your font.</p>

<div class='htmlonly'>

<p class='c001'>The scope of this volume includes topics from ‘Falkland’ to ‘Mark’. There
are numerous cross-references between topics, many of themm to be found in other
volumes of this edition. Several of these are already provided by Project
Gutenberg, but without the mechanism of allowing for external hyperlinks. To avoid
any confusion, none of the references were linked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Corrections are indicated using an <ins class='correction' title='original'>underline</ins>
highlight. Placing the cursor over the correction will produce the
original text in a small popup.</p>

<b>Skeggs</b> (<i>Miss Carolina Wilhelmina
Amelia</i>), the companion
of “Lady Blarney.”
These were two flash
women, introduced by
Squire Tuthill to the Primrose
family, with a view of beguiling the
two eldest daughters, who were both very
beautiful. Sir William Thornhill thwarted
their infamous purpose.--Goldsmith, <cite>Vicar
of Wakefield</cite> (1766).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skeleton</b> (<i>Sam</i>), a smuggler.--Sir W.
Scott, <cite>Redgauntlet</cite> (time, George III.).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sketchley</b> (<i>Arthur</i>), George Rose, author
of <cite>Mrs. Brown</cite> (her observations on
men and objects, politics and manners,
etc.).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skettles</b> (<i>Sir Barnet</i>), of Fulham. He
expressed his importance by an antique
gold snuff-box and a silk handkerchief.
His hobby was to extend his acquaintances,
and to introduce people to each
other. Skettles, junior, was a pupil of
Dr. Blimber.--C. Dickens, <cite>Dombey and Son</cite>
(1846).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skevington’s Daughter</b>, an instrument
of torture invented by Skevington,
lieutenant of the Tower, in the reign of
Henry VIII. It consisted of a broad iron
hoop, in two parts, jointed with a hinge.
The victim was put into the hoop, which
was then squeezed close and locked. Here
he remained for about an hour and a half
in the most inexpressible torture. (Generally
corrupted into the “Scavenger’s
Daughter.”)</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skewton</b> (<i>The Hon. Mrs.</i>), mother of
Edith (Mr. Dombey’s second wife). Having
once been a beauty, she painted when
old and shrivelled, became enthusiastic
about the “charms of nature,” and reclined
in her bath-chair in the attitude she assumed
in her barouche when young and
well off. A fashionable artist had painted
her likeness in this attitude, and called
his picture “Cleopatra.” The Hon. Mrs.
Skewton was the sister of the late Lord
Feenix, and aunt to the present lord.--C.
Dickens, <cite>Dombey and Son</cite> (1846).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skiffins</b> (<i>Miss</i>), an angular, middle-aged
woman, who wears “green kid gloves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>when dressed for company.” She marries
Wemmick.--C. Dickens, <cite>Great Expectations</cite>
(1860).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skimpole</b> (<i>Harold</i>), an amateur artist,
always sponging on his friends. Under
a plausible, light-hearted manner he was
intensely selfish, but Mr. Jarndyce looked
on him as a mere child, and believed in
him implicitly.--C. Dickens, <cite>Bleak House</cite>
(1852).</p>

<p class='c001'>(The original of this character was Leigh
Hunt, who was greatly displeased at the
skit.)</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skin</b> (<i>The Man without a</i>), Richard
Cumberland. So called by Garrick, on
account of his painful sensitiveness of all
criticism. The same irritability of temper
made Sheridan caricature him in <cite>The
Critic</cite> as “Sir Fretful Plagiary” (1732-1811).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skinfaxi</b> (“<em>shining mane</em>”), the horse
which draws the chariot of day.--<cite>Scandinavian
Mythology.</cite></p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skofnung</b>, the sword of King Rolf,
the Norway hero, preserved for centuries
in Iceland.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skogan.</b> (See <span class='sc'>Scogan</span>.)</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skreigh</b> (<i>Mr.</i>), the precentor at the
Gordon Arms inn, Kippletringan.--Sir
W. Scott, <cite>Guy Mannering</cite> (time, George
II.).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skulls at Banquets.</b> Plutarch tells
us that towards the close of an Egyptian
feast a servant brought in a skeleton, and
cried to the guests, “Eat, drink, and be
merry, for to-morrow you die!”</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skurliewhitter</b> (<i>Andrew</i>), the scrivener.--Sir
W. Scott, <cite>Fortunes of Nigel</cite> (time,
James I.).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sky-Lark</b>, a lark with the “skies,”
or ’scīs. The Westminster boys used to
style themselves <em>Romans</em>, and the “town,”
<em>Volsci</em>; the latter word was curtailed to
<em>’sci</em> [<em>sky</em>]. A row between the Westminsterians
and the town roughs was called a
<em>’sci-lark</em>, or a lark with the Volsci.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Skyresh Bol´golam</b>, the high admiral
or galbert of the realm of Lilliput.--Swift,

iii., 1726).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slackbridge</b>, one of the “hands” in
Bounderby’s mill at Coketown. Slackbridge
is an ill-conditioned fellow, ill-made,
with lowering eyebrows, and
though inferior to many of the others,
exercises over them a great influence.
He is the orator, who stirs up his fellow-workmen
to strike.--C. Dickens, <cite>Hard
Times</cite> (1854).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slammerkin</b> (<i>Mrs.</i>). Captain Macheath
says of her, “She is careless and
genteel.” “All you fine ladies,” he adds,
“who know your own beauty, affect an
undress.”--Gay, <cite>The Beggar’s Opera</cite>, ii.
1 (1727).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slander</b>, an old hag, of “ragged, rude
attyre, and filthy lockes,” who sucked
venom out of her nails. It was her nature
to abuse all goodness, to frame groundless
charges, to “steale away the crowne of a
good name,” and “never thing so well was
doen, but she with blame would blot, and
of due praise deprive.”</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slang</b>, from Slangenberg, a Dutch
general, noted for his abusive and exaggerated
epithets when he reproved the
men under his command. The etymon
is suited to this dictionary, and the following
are not without wit:--Italian,
<em>s-lingua</em>, <em>s</em> negative and <em>lingua</em> = “bad
language;” French, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>esclandre</em></span>, “an event
which gives rise to scandal,” hence, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>faire
esclandre</em></span>, “to expose one to scandal,”
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>causer de l’escandre</em></span>, “to give ground for
scandal;” Greek, <em>skandălon</em>, “an offense, a
scandal.” “Slangs,” fetters for malefactors.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slango</b>, a lad, servant of Gaylove, a
young barrister. He dresses up as a woman,
and when Squire Sapskull comes
from Yorkshire for a wife, Slango passes
himself off as Arbella. In the mean time,
Gaylove assumes the airs and manners of
a Yorkshire tike, and marries Arbella,
with whom he is in love.--Carey, <cite>The
Honest Yorkshireman</cite> (1736).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slawken-Ber´gius Hafen</b>, an imaginary
author, distinguished for the great
length of his nose. In the <cite>Life and Opinions
of Tristram Shandy</cite> (by Sterne), Slawken-Bergius
is referred to as a great authority
on all lore connected with noses, and a
curious tale is introduced from his hypothetical
works about a man with an enormously
long nose.</p>

<p class='c018'>No nose can be justly amputated by the public,
not even the nose of Slawken-Bergius himself.--Carlyle.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Slaygood</b> (<i>Giant</i>), master of a gang of
thieves which infested the King’s highway.
Mr. Greatheart slew him, and rescued
Feeblemind from his grasp in a duel.--Bunyan,
<cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, ii. (1684).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sleary</b>, proprietor of the circus at
Coketown. A stout man with one eye
fixed and one loose, a voice like the efforts
of a broken pair of bellows, a flabby skin,
and muddled head. He was never sober
and never drunk, but always kind-hearted.
Tom Gradgrind, after robbing the bank,
lay concealed in this circus as a black servant
till Sleary connived at his escape.
This Sleary did in gratitude to Thomas
Gradgrind, Esq., M.P., who adopted and
educated Cecilia Jupe, daughter of his
clown, Signor Jupe.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sleeper Awakened</b> (<i>The</i>). Abou
Hassan, the son of a rich merchant at
Bagdad, inherited a good fortune; but,
being a prudent man, made a vow to divide
it into two parts: all that came to
him from rents he determined to set apart,
but all that was of the nature of cash he
resolved to spend on pleasure. In the
course of a year he ran through this fund,
and then made a resolve in future to ask
only one guest at a time to his board. This
guest was to be a stranger, and never to
be asked a second time. It so happened
that the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, disguised
as a merchant, was on one occasion
his guest, and heard Abou Hassan say that
he wished he were caliph for one day, and
he would punish a certain imân for tittle-tattling.
Haroun-al-Raschid thought that
he could make capital of this wish for a
little diversion; so, drugging the merchant’s
wine, he fell into a profound sleep,
was conveyed to the palace, and, on waking,
was treated as the caliph. He ordered
the imân to be punished, and sent his
mother a handsome gift; but at night,
another sleeping draught being given him,
he was carried back to his own house.
When he woke he could not decide if he
had been in a dream or not, but his conduct
was so strange that he was taken to
a mad-house. He was confined for several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>days, and, being discharged, the caliph in
disguise again visited him, and repeated
the same game, so that next day he could
not tell which had been the dream. At
length the mystery was cleared up, and he
was given a post about the caliph’s person,
and the sultana gave him a beautiful slave
for his wife. Abou Hassan now played a
trick on the caliph. He pretended to be
dead, and sent his young wife to the sultana
to announce the sad news. Zobeida,
the sultana, was very much grieved, and
gave her favorite a sum of money for the
funeral expenses. On her return she
played the dead woman, and Abou Hassan
went to the caliph to announce his loss.
The caliph expressed his sympathy, and,
having given him a sum of money for the
funeral expenses, went to the sultana to
speak of the sad news of the death of the
young bride. “The bride?” cried Zobeida;
“you mean the bridegroom, commander
of the faithful.” “No, I mean the bride,”
answered the caliph, “for Abou Hassan
has but just left me.” “That cannot be,
sire,” retorted Zobeida, “for it is not an
hour ago that the bride was here to announce
his death.” To settle this moot
point, the chief of the eunuchs was sent
to see which of the two was dead; and
Abou, who saw him coming, got the bride
to pretend to be dead, and set himself at
her head bewailing, so the man returned
with the report that it was the bride who
was dead, and not the bridegroom. The
sultana would not believe him, and sent
her aged nurse to ascertain the fact. As
she approached, Abou Hassan pretended
to be dead, and the bride to be the wailing
widow; accordingly, the nurse contradicted
the report of the eunuch. The caliph
and sultana, with the nurse and
eunuch, then all went to see for themselves,
and found both apparently dead.
The caliph now said he would give 1000
pieces of gold to know which died first,
when Abou Hassan cried, “Commander
of the faithful, it was I who died first.”
The trick was found out, the caliph nearly
died with laughter, and the jest proved a
little mine of wealth to the court favorite.--<cite>Arabian
Nights.</cite></p>

this: Aladine, king of Jerusalem, stole
from a Christian church an image of the
Virgin, being told by a magician that it
was a palladium, and, if set up in a mosque,
the Virgin would forsake the Christian
army, and favor the Mohammedan. The
image was accordingly set up in a mosque,
but during the night was carried off by
some one. Aladine, greatly enraged, ordered
the instant execution of all his
Christian subjects, but, to prevent this
massacre, Sofronia accused herself of the
offence. Her lover, Olindo, hearing that
Sofronia was sentenced to death, presented
himself before the king, and said that he
and not Sofronia was the real offender;
whereupon the king ordered both to instant
execution; but Clorinda, the Amăzon,
pleading for them, obtained their
pardon, and Sofronia left the stake to
join Olindo at the altar of matrimony.--Bk. ii.</p>

<p class='c001'>This episode may have been suggested
by a well-known incident in ecclesiastical

Amachius, the governor of the province,
ordered the temple to be opened, and the
idols to be cleansed. Three Christians,
inflamed with Christian zeal, went by
night and broke all the images. The governor,
unable to discover the culprits,
commanded all the Christians of Merum
to be put to death; but the three who
had been guilty of the act confessed

by A. Cherry (1804). Mrs. Cheerly, the
daughter of Colonel Woodley, after a marriage
of three years, is left a widow,
young, rich, gay, and engaging. She
comes to London, and Frank Heartall, a
generous-minded young merchant, sees
her at the opera, falls in love with her,
and follows her to her lodging. Here he
meets with the Malfort family, reduced to
abject poverty by speculation, and relieves
them. Ferret, the villain of the
piece, spreads a report that Frank gave
the money as hush-money, because he had
base designs on Mrs. Malfort; but his
character is cleared, and he leads to the
altar the blooming young widow, while
the return of Malfort’s father places his
son again in prosperous circumstances.</p>

The monarch of these spirits was called

<p class='c001'><i>Solomon died standing.</i> Solomon employed
the genii in building the Temple,
but, perceiving that his end was at hand,
prayed God that his death might be concealed
from the genii till the work was
completed. Accordingly, he died standing,
leaning on his staff as if in prayer.
The genii, supposing him to be alive,
toiled on, and when the Temple was fully
built, a worm knawed the staff, and the
corpse fell prostrate to the earth. Mahomet
refers to this as a fact:</p>

<p class='c018'>When We [<i>God</i>] had decreed that Solomon
should die, nothing discovered his death unto
them [<em>the genii</em>] except the creeping thing of the
earth, which gnawed his staff. And when his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>[<em>dead</em>] body fell down, the genii plainly perceived

<p class='c001'><i>Solomon Kills His Horses.</i> Solomon
bought a thousand horses, and went to
examine them. The examination took
him the whole day, so that he omitted the
prayers which he ought to have repeated.
This neglect came into his mind at sunset,
and, by way of atonement, he slew all the
horses except a hundred of the best “as
an offering to God;” and God, to make
him amends for his loss, gave him the
dominion of the winds. Mahomet refers
to this in the following passage:--</p>

<p class='c018'>When the horses, standing on three feet, and
touching the ground with the edge of the fourth
foot, swift in the course, were set in parade before
him [<em>Solomon</em>] in the evening, he said, “Verily
I have loved the love of earthly good above
the remembrance of my Lord; and I have spent
the time in viewing these horses till the sun is hidden
by the veil of night. Bring the horses back
unto me.” And when they were brought back,
he began to cut off their legs and their necks.--<cite>Al
Korân</cite>, xxxvii.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Solomon’s Mode of Travelling.</i> Solomon
had a carpet of green silk, on which his
throne was placed. This carpet was large
enough for all his army to stand on. When
his soldiers had stationed themselves on
his right hand, and the spirits on his left,
Solomon commanded the winds to convey
him whither he listed. Whereupon the
winds buoyed up the carpet, and transported
it to the place the king wished to
go to, and while passing thus through the
air, the birds of heaven hovered overhead
forming a canopy with their wings to ward
off the heat of the sun. Mahomet takes
this legend as an historic fact, for he says
in reference to it:</p>

<p class='c018'>Unto Solomon We subjected the strong wind,
and it ran at his command to the land whereon
We had bestowed our blessing.--<cite>Al Korân</cite>, xxi.</p>

<p class='c016'>And again:</p>

<p class='c018'>We made the wind subject to him, and it ran
gently at his command whithersoever he desired.--<cite>Al
Korân</cite>, xxxviii.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Solomon’s Signet-Ring.</i> The rabbins say
that Solomon wore a ring in which was
set a chased stone that told him everything
he wished to know.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Solomon Loses His Signet-Ring.</i> Solomon’s
favorite concubine was Amīna,
daughter of Jerâda, king of Tyre, and
when he went to bathe, it was to Amina
that he entrusted his signet-ring. One
day the devil, Sakhar, assumed the likeness
of Solomon, and so got possession of
the ring, and for forty days reigned in Jerusalem,
while Solomon himself was a wanderer
living on alms. At the end of the
forty days, Sakhar flung the ring into the
sea; it was swallowed by a fish, which was
given to Solomon. Having thus obtained
his ring again, Solomon took Sakhar captive,
and cast him into the sea of Galilee.--<cite>Al
Korân</cite> (Sale’s notes, ch. xxxviii.).
(See <span class='sc'>Jovian</span>.)</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Mahomet, in the <cite>Korân</cite>, takes this
legend as an historic fact, for he says:
“We [<em>God</em>], also tried Solomon, and
placed on his throne a counterfeit body
[<i>i.e.</i>, <cite>Sakhar, the Devil</cite>].”--Ch. xxxviii.</p>

<p class='c001'>Uffan, the sage, saw Solomon asleep,
and wishing to take off his signet-ring,
gave three arrows to Aboutaleb, saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“When the serpent springs upon me, and
strikes me dead, shoot one of these arrows
at me, and I shall instantly come to
life again.” Uffan tugged at the ring, was
stung to death, but, being struck by one
of the arrows, revived. This happened
twice. After the third attempt, the heavens
grew so black, and the thunder was so
alarming, that Aboutaleb was afraid to
shoot, and throwing down the bow and
arrow, fled with precipitation from the
dreadful place.--Comte de Caylus, <cite>Oriental

been turned three times. In regard to the
other idiosyncrasy, he boasts of his cellar

He was a blind man, who fawned

<p class='c016'><b>Standard.</b> A substantial building for
water supplies, as the Water Standard of
Cornhill, the Standard in Cheap, opposite
Honey Lane, “which John Wells, grocer,
caused to be made [? <em>rebuilt</em>] in his mayoralty,
1430.”--Stow, <cite>Survey</cite> (“Cheapside”).</p>

<p class='c001'><i>The Cheapside Standard.</i> This Standard
was in existence in the reign of Edward I.
In the reign of Edward III. two fishmongers
were beheaded at the Cheapside
Standard, for aiding in a riot. Henry IV.
caused “the blank charter of Richard II.”
to be burnt at this place.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>The Standard, Cornhill.</i> This was a
conduit with four spouts, made by Peter
Morris, a German, in 1582, and supplied
with Thames water, conveyed by leaden
pipes over the steeple of St. Magnus’s
Church. It stood at the east end of Cornhill,
at its junction with Gracechurch
Street, Bishopsgate Street, and Leadenhall
Street. The water ceased to run between
1598 and 1603, but the Standard
itself remained long after. Distances from
London were measured from this spot.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the year 1775, there stood upon the borders
of Epping Forest, at a distance of about
twelve miles from London, measuring from the
Standard in Cornhill, or rather from the spot
on which the Standard used to be, a house of
public entertainment, called the Maypole.--Dickens,

<p class='c016'><i>Standard</i> (<i>The Battle of the</i>), the battle
of Luton Moor, near Northallerton, between
the English and the Scotch, in
1138. So called from the “standard,”
which was raised on a wagon, and placed
in the centre of the English army. The
pole displayed the standards of St. Cuthbert
of Durham, St. Peter of York, St.
John of Beverley, and St. Wilfred of
Ripon, surmounted by a little silver casket,
containing a consecrated wafer.--Hailes,
<cite>Annals of Scotland</cite>, i. 85 (1779).</p>

<p class='c018'>The Battle of the Standard, was so called
from the banner of St. Cuthbert, which was
thought always to secure success. It came forth
at the battle of Nevil’s Cross, and was again victorious.
It was preserved with great reverence
till the Reformation, when, in 1549, Catharine
Whittingham (a French lady), wife of the dean
of Durham, burnt it out of zeal against popery.--Miss
Yonge, <cite>Cameos of English History</cite>, 126-8

“the beautiful puritan,” he sent

he felt himself growing old, he hung a bag
of gold round his neck, and told Olo he
might take the bag of gold if he would cut
off his head, and he did so. He hated
luxury in every form, and said a man was
a fool who went and dined out for the
sake of better fare. One day, Helgo, king
of Norway, asked him to be his champion
in a contest which was to be decided by
himself alone against nine adversaries.
Starchaterus selected for the site of combat
the top of a mountain covered with
snow, and, throwing off his clothes, waited
for the nine adversaries. When asked if
he would fight with them one by one or all
together, he replied, “When dogs bark at

accepted the invitation of Starno, and
spent three days in boar-hunts. He was
then warned by Agandecca to beware of
her father, who had set an ambuscade to
waylay him. Fingal, being forewarned,
fell on the ambush and slew every man.
When Starno heard thereof, he slew his

the proud spirit of the princess was indignant,
but Alexander, by his love, won

She married Lord Rich, and was a widow

Stella died of grief, and the “two lovers”

“Starlight,” which is first red, and, as it
fades, turns blue. Some call it <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>penthea</em></span>,
but henceforth (he says) it shall be called

<p class='c016'><i>Sword</i> (<i>The Marvel of the</i>). When King
Arthur first appears on the scene, he is
brought into notice by the “Marvel of the
Sword;” and Sir Galahad, who was to
achieve the Holy Graal, was introduced to
knighthood by a similar adventure. That
of Arthur is thus described:</p>

<p class='c018'>In the greatest church of London ... there
was seen in the churchyard, against the high
altar, a great stone, foursquare, like to a marble
stone, and in the midst thereof, was an anvil of
steel a foot in height, and therein stuck a fair
sword, naked by the point, and letters of gold
were written about the sword that said thus:
<em>Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and
anvil, is rightwise king born of England.</em> [<em>Arthur
was the only person who could draw it out,
so he was acknowledged to be the rightful king.</em>]--Pt.
i. 3, 4.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sword adventure of Sir Galahad, at
the age of 15, is thus given:</p>

<p class='c018'>The king and his knights came to the river
and they found there a stone floating, as it had
been of red marble, and therein stuck a fair
and rich sword, and in the pomell thereof were
precious stones, wrought with subtil letters of
gold. Then the barons read the letters, which
said in this wise: <em>Never shall man take me hence,
but only he by whom I ought to hang, and he
shall be the best knight of the world.</em> [<em>Sir Galahad
drew the sword easily, but no other knight
was able to pull it forth.</em>]--Sir T. Malory, <cite>History
of Prince Arthur</cite>, iii. 30, 31 (1470).</p>

<p class='c016'>A somewhat similar adventure occurs
in the <span lang="laa" xml:lang="laa"><cite>Amădis de Gaul</cite></span>. Whoever succeeded
in drawing from a rock an enchanted
sword, was to gain access to a
subterranean treasure (ch. cxxx.; see also
lxxii. xcix.).</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Sword</i> (<i>The Irresistible</i>). The king of
Araby and Ind sent Cambuscan´, king of
Tartary, a sword that would pierce any
armor, and if the smiter chose he could
heal the wound again by striking it with
the flat of the blade.--Chaucer, <cite>The
Squire’s Tale</cite> (1388).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sword and the Maiden</b> (<i>The</i>). Soon
after King Arthur succeeded to the
throne, a damsel came to Camelot girded
with a sword which no man defiled by
“shame, treachery, or guile” could draw
from its scabbard. She had been to the
court of King Ryence, but no knight
there could draw it. King Arthur tried
to draw it, but with no better success; all
his knights tried also, but none could
draw it. At last a poor ragged knight
named Balin, who had been held in prison
for six months, made the attempt, and
drew the sword with the utmost ease, but
the knights insisted it had been done by
witchcraft. The maiden asked Sir Balin
to give her the sword, but he refused to
do so, and she then told him it would
bring death to himself and his dearest
friend; and so it did; for when he and
his brother, Balan, jousted together, unknown
to each other, both were slain, and
were buried in one tomb.--Sir T. Malory,
<cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite>, i. 27-44 (1470).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Sword in the City Arms</b> (<i>London</i>).
Stow asserts that the sword or dagger in
the City arms was not added in commemoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of Walworth’s attack on Wat
Tyler, but that it represents the sword of
St. Paul, the patron saint of London.
This is not correct. Without doubt the
cognizance of the City, previous to 1381,
was St. Paul’s sword, but after the death
of Tyler, it was changed into Walworth’s

Marius got the appointment of Sylla set
aside in favor of himself. Sylla, in dudgeon,
hastened back to Rome, and insisted
that the “recall” should be reversed.
Marius fled. Sylla pursued the
war with success, returned to Rome in
triumph, and made a wholesale slaughter
of the Romans who had opposed him.
As many as 7000 soldiers and 5000 private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>citizens fell in this massacre, and all
their goods were distributed among his
own partisans. Sylla was now called
“Perpetual Dictator,” but in two years
retired into private life, and died the year
following (<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 78).</p>

<p class='c001'>Jouy has a good tragedy in French

a ditty lovely well,” and prided himself
“on his pretty spider fingers, and the
twinkling of his two eyes.” Of course,
Camiŏla sees no charms in these effeminacies;
but the conceited puppy says he
“is not so sorry for himself as he is for

withdraw her from his society; but she
dressed in her brother’s military suit, assumed
the name of Jack Wilful, <em>alias</em>

“I have examined,” he says, “fifteen of
them, and am positive that the tail is a
natural appendage.” Dr. Wolf, in his
<cite>Travels and Adventures</cite>, ii. (1861), says:
“There are both men and women in Abyssinia
with tails like dogs and horses.” He
heard that, near Narea, in Abyssinia, there

that they could “knock down a horse
with a blow.”</p>

a foot long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is said that the Ghilane race, which
numbers between 30,000 and 40,000 souls,
and dwell “far beyond the Senaar,” have

of his tutelary charge of Abu´dah, a merchant
of Bagdad. The genius, Mamlouk,
told how he had been employed in watching
over the Dervise Alfouran. Next,
Omphram recounted his labors as the

told the tale of the Sultan Misnar, with
the episodes of Mahoud and the princess

<p class='c016'><b>Talisman</b> (<i>The</i>), a novel by Sir W.
Scott, and one of the best of the thirty-two
which he wrote (1825). It relates
how Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion was cured of
a fever in the Holy Land, by Saladin, the
soldan, his noble enemy. Saladin, hearing
of his illness, assumed the disguise of
Adonbec el Hakim, the physician, and visited
the king. He filled a cup with spring
water, into which he dipped the talisman,
a little red purse that he took from his
bosom, and when it had been steeped long
enough, he gave the draught to the king
to drink (ch. ix.). During the king’s sickness,
the archduke of Austria planted his
own banner beside that of England; but
as soon as Richard recovered from his
fever he tore down the Austrian banner,
and gave it in custody to Sir Kenneth.
While Kenneth was absent he left his
dog in charge of it, but on his return,
found the dog wounded, and the banner
stolen. King Richard, in his rage, ordered
Sir Kenneth to execution, but pardoned
him on the intercession of “the physician”
(Saladin). Sir Kenneth’s dog showed
such a strange aversion to the Marquis de
Montserrat, that suspicion was aroused,
the marquis was challenged to single combat,
and, being overthrown by Sir Kenneth,
confessed that he had stolen the
banner. The love story interwoven is
that between Sir Kenneth, the prince
royal of Scotland, and Lady Edith Plantagenet,
the king’s kinswoman, with whose
marriage the tale concludes.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Talismans</b> (<i>The Four</i>). Houna, surnamed

three of great value: viz., a little golden
fish, which would fetch out of the sea
whatever it was bidden; a poniard, which
rendered invisible not only the person
bearing it, but all those he wished to be
so; and a ring of steel, which enabled the
wearer to read the <a id='corr72L.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='secret’s'>secrets</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_72L.19'><ins class='correction' title='secret’s'>secrets</ins></a></span> of men’s hearts.

lord high chancellor of Sicily. While
only a count, he fell in love with Sigismunda,
the chancellor’s daughter, but
when King Roger died, he left the throne
to Tancred, provided he married Constantia,
daughter of William the Bad, and
thus united the rival lines. Tancred gave
a tacit consent to this arrangement, intending
all the time to obtain a dispensation
from the pope, and marry the chancellor’s
daughter; but Sigismunda could
not know his secret intentions, and, in a
fit of irritation, married the Earl Osmond.
Now follows the catastrophe: Tancred
sought an interview with Sigismunda, to
justify his conduct, but Osmond challenged

with the Ritter on supernatural
subjects, and promises that Venus herself
shall be his mistress, if he will summon
up his courage to enter Venusberg. Tannhäuser
starts on the mysterious journey,
and Lisaura, hearing thereof, kills herself.
At Venusberg, the Ritter gives full
swing to his pleasures, but in time returns
to Mantua, and makes his confession to
Pope Urban. His holiness says to him,
“Man, you can no more hope for absolution,
than this staff which I hold in my
hand, can be expected to bud.” So Tannhäuser
flees in despair from Rome, and
returns to Venusberg. Meanwhile, the
pope’s staff actually does sprout, and Urban
sends in all directions for the Ritter,
but he is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tieck, in his <cite>Phantasus</cite> (1812), introduces
the story. Wagner (in 1845) brought

<p class='c001'>⁂ The tale of Tannhäuser is substantially

Faëry folk, that he could foretell what
events would come to pass. He was also
a bard, and wrote the famous lay of <cite>Sir
Tristrem</cite>. The general belief is, that the
seer is not dead, but has been simply
removed from the land of the living
to Faëry-land, whence occasionally he
emerges, to busy himself with human
affairs. Sir W. Scott has introduced the

<p class='c016'><b>Tappertit</b> (<i>Sim</i>, i.e., <em>Simon</em>), the apprentice
of Gabriel Varden, locksmith. He
was just 20 in years, but 200 in conceit.
An old-fashioned, thin-faced, sleek-haired,
sharp-nosed, small-eyed little fellow was
Mr. Sim Tappertit, about five feet high,
but thoroughly convinced in his own mind
that he was both good looking and above
the middle size, in fact, rather tall than
otherwise. His figure, which was slender,
he was proud of; and with his legs, which
in knee-breeches were perfect curiosities
of littleness, he was enraptured. He had
also a secret notion that the power of his
eye was irresistible, and he believed that
he could subdue the haughtiest beauty
“by eyeing her.” Of course Mr. Tappertit
had an ambitious soul, and admired his
master’s daughter, Dolly. He was captain
of the secret society of “’Prentice Knights,”
whose object was “vengeance against
their tyrant masters.” After the Gordon
riots, in which Tappertit took a leading
part, he was found “burnt and bruised,
with a gun-shot wound in his body and
both his legs crushed into shapeless ugliness.”
The cripple, by the locksmith’s
aid, turned shoe-black under an archway
near the Horse Guards, thrived in his vocation,
and married the widow of a rag-and-bone
collector. While an apprentice,
Miss Miggs, the “protestant” shrewish
servant of Mrs. Varden, cast an eye of
hope on “Simmun;” but the conceited

tragedy called <cite>Brutus</cite>, on the same subject.
It also forms indirectly the subject of one
of the lays of Lord Macaulay, called <cite>The
Battle of the Lake Regillus</cite> (1842), a battle
undertaken by the Sabines for the restoration
of Tarquin, but in which the king

<p class='c016'><b>Tarquinia</b>, wife of Titus, son of

in spirit by his ill success, the giant commits
suicide. Tartaro, the son of a king,
was made a monster out of punishment,
and was never to lose his deformity till he
married. One day he asked a girl to be
his bride, and on being refused, sent her
“a talking ring,” which talked without
ceasing immediately she put it on; so
she cut off her finger and threw it into a
large pond, and there the Tartaro drowned
himself.--Rev. W. Webster, <cite>Basque Legends</cite>,

<p class='c001'>In one of the Basque legends, Tartaro
is represented as a Polyphēmos, whose
one eye is bored out with spits made red

inadvertently into his dwelling. Like
Ulysses, the leader of these seamen made
his escape by the aid of a ram, but with
this difference--he did not, like Ulysses,
cling to the ram’s belly, but fastened the
ram’s bell round his neck and threw a
sheep-skin over his shoulders. When
Tartaro laid hold of the fugitive, the man
escaped, leaving the sheep-skin in the
giant’s hand.</p>

and Penelŏpê. When Ulysses had been
absent from home nearly twenty years,
Telemachus went to Pylos and Sparta, to
gain information about him. Nestor received
him hospitably at Pylos, and sent
him to Sparta, where Menelāus told him
the prophecy of Proteus (2 <i>syl.</i>), concerning
Ulysses. He then returned home,
where he found his father, and assisted
him in slaying the suitors. Telemachus
was accompanied in his voyage by the
goddess of wisdom, under the form of
Mentor, one of his father’s friends. (See
<span class='sc'>Telemaque</span>.)--<cite>Greek Fable.</cite></p>

<p class='c016'><b>Télémaque</b> (<i>Les Aventures de</i>) a
French prose epic, in twenty-four books,
by Fénelon (1699). The first six books
contain the story of the hero’s adventures,
told to Calypso, as Ænēas told the story
of the burning of Troy and his travels
from Troy to Carthage to Queen Dido.
Télémaque says to the goddess that he
started with Mentor from Ithăca, in search
of his father, who had been absent from
home for nearly twenty years. He first
went to inquire of old Nestor if he could
give him any information on the subject,
and Nestor told him to go to Sparta, and
have an interview with Menelāus. On
leaving Lacedæmonia, he was shipwrecked
off the coast of Sicily, but was kindly
treated by King Acestês, who furnished
him with a ship to take him home (bk. i.).
This ship fell into the hands of some
Egyptians; he was parted from Mentor,
and sent to feed sheep in Egypt. King
Sesostris, conceiving a high opinion of
the young man, would have sent him
home, but died, and Télémaque was incarcerated
by his successor in a dungeon
overlooking the sea (bk. ii.). After a time
he was released and sent to Tyre. Here
he would have been put to death by Pygmalīon,
had he not been rescued by Astarbê,
the king’s mistress (bk. iii.). Again
he embarked, reached Cyprus, and sailed
thence to Crete. In this passage he saw
Amphitrītê, the wife of the sea-god, in
her magnificent chariot, drawn by sea-horses
(bk. iv.). On landing in Crete, he
was told the tale of King Idomĕneus
(4 <i>syl.</i>), who made a vow if he reached
home in safety, after the siege of Troy,
that he would offer in sacrifice the first
living being that came to meet him. This
happened to be his own son; but when
Idomeneus proceeded to do according to
his vow, the Cretans were so indignant
that they drove him from the island.
Being without a ruler, the islanders asked
Télémaque to be their king (bk. v.). This
he declined, but Mentor advised the Cretans
to place the reigns of government in
the hands of Aristodēmus. On leaving
Crete, the vessel was again wrecked, and
Télémaque, with Mentor, was cast on the
island of Calypso (bk vi.). Here the narrative
closes, and the rest of the story
gives the several adventures of Télémaque
from this point till he reaches Ithaca.
Calypso, having fallen in love with the
young prince, tried to detain him in her
island, and even burnt the ship which
Mentor had built to carry them home;
but Mentor determined to quit the island,
threw Télémaque from a crag into the sea,
and then leaped in after him. They had
now to swim for their lives, and they kept
themselves afloat till they were picked up
by some Tyrians (bk. vii.). The captain
of the ship was very friendly to Télémaque,
and promised to take him with
his friend to Ithaca, but the pilot by mistake
landed them on Salentum (bk. ix.).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Here Télémaque, being told that his father
was dead, determined to go down to the
infernal regions to see him (bk. xviii.).
In Hadês he was informed that Ulysses
was still alive (bk. xix.). So he returned
to the upper earth (bk. xxii.), embarked
again, and this time reached Ithaca, where
he found his father, and Mentor left him.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Tell</b> (<i>William</i>), a famous chief of the
confederates of the forest cantons of Switzerland,
and son-in-law of Walter Furst.
Having refused to salute the Austrian cap
which Gessler, the Austrian governor, had
set up in the market-place of Altorf, he
was condemned to shoot an apple from the
head of his own son. He succeeded in
this perilous task, but letting fall a concealed
arrow, was asked by Gessler with
what object he had secreted it. “To kill
thee, tyrant,” he replied, “if I had failed.”
The governor now ordered him to be carried
in chains across the Lake Lucerne to
Küssnacht Castle, “there to be devoured
alive by reptiles;” but, a violent storm
having arisen on the lake, he was unchained,
that he might take the helm.
Gessler was on board, and when the vessel
neared the castle, Tell leapt ashore, gave
the boat a push into the lake, and shot the
governor. After this he liberated his
country from the Austrian yoke (1307).</p>

<p class='c001'>This story of William Tell is told of a
host of persons. For example: Egil, the
brother of Wayland Smith, was commanded
by King Nidung to shoot an apple
from the head of his son. Egil, like Tell,
took two arrows, and being asked why,
replied, as Tell did to Gessler, “To shoot
thee, tyrant, if I fail in my task.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A similar story is told of Olaf and Eindridi,
in Norway. King Olaf dared Eindridi
to a trial of skill. An apple was
placed on the head of Eindridi’s son, and
the king shooting at it grazed the boy’s
head, but the father carried off the apple
clean. Eindridi had concealed an arrow
to aim at the king, if the boy had been injured.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another Norse tale is told of Hemingr
and Harald, son of Sigurd (1066). After
various trials of skill, Harald told Hemingr
to shoot a nut from the head of Bjorn,
his younger brother. In this he succeeded,
not with an arrow, but with a spear.</p>

<p class='c001'>A similar tale is related of Geyti, son of
Aslak, and the same Harald. The place of
trial was the Faroe Isles. In this case

spaces without touching one of the fingers.</p>

prose-poems, in eight books. The subject
is the dethronement of the kings of Connaught,
and consolidation of the two Irish
kingdoms in that of Ulster. It must be
borne in mind that there were two colonies
in Ireland--one the Fir-bolg, or British
Belgæ, settled in the south, whose king
was called the “lord of Atha,” from Atha,
in Connaught, the seat of government;
and the other the Cael, from Caledonia, in
Scotland, whose seat of government was
Temŏra, in Ulster. When Crothar was
“lord of Atha,” he wished to unite the
two kingdoms, and, with this view, carried
off Conlāma, only child of the rival king,
and married her. The Caledonians of
Scotland interfered, and Conar, the brother
of Fingal, was sent with an army against
the usurper, conquered him, reduced the
south to a tributary state, and restored, in
his own person, the kingdom of Ulster.
After a few years, Cormac II. (a minor)
became king of Ulster and over-lord of
Connaught. The Fir-bolg, seizing this
opportunity of revolt, Cairbar, “lord of
Atha,” threw off his subjection, and murdered
the young king in his palace of
Temora. Fingal interfered in behalf of
the Caels; but no sooner had he landed
in Ireland than Cairbar invited Oscar (Fingal’s
grandson) to a banquet, picked a
quarrel with him in the banquet hall, and
both fell dead, each by the other’s hand.
On the death of Cairbar, Faldath became
leader of the Fir-bolg, but was slain by
Fillan, son of Fingal. Fillan, in turn, was
slain by Clathmor, brother of Cairbar.
Fingal now took the lead of his army in
person, slew Clathmor, reduced the Fir-bolg
to submission, and placed on the

only other inhabitants were Caliban, the
son of Sycorax, a strange, misshapen
thing, like a gorilla, and Ariel, a sprite,
who had been imprisoned by Sycorax for
twelve years in the rift of a pine tree,
from which Prospero set him free. One
day Prospero saw a ship off the island,
and raised a tempest to wreck it. By this
means his brother, Anthonio, Prince Ferdinand,
and the king of Naples, were
brought to the island. Now it must be
known that Prospero was once duke of
Milan; but his brother, Anthonio, aided
by the king of Naples, had usurped the
throne, and set Prospero and Miranda
adrift in a small boat, which was wind-driven
to this desert island. Ferdinand
(son of the king of Naples) and Miranda
fell in love with each other, and the rest
of the shipwrecked party being brought

Spain, and met a scholar who told him of
the overthrow of the Guelfi. Struck with
grief, he lost his road, and wandered into
a wood, where Dame Nature accosted him,
and disclosed to him the secrets of her
works. On he wandered till he came to
a vast plain, inhabited by Virtue and her
four daughters, together with Courtesy,
Bounty, Loyalty, and Prowess. Leaving
this, he came to a fertile valley, which
was for ever shifting its appearance, from
round to square, from light to darkness.
This was the valley of Queen Pleasure,

savored more of tribute than of charity,
and refused to give anything; but afterwards
repenting, he took to the “prophet”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>a good round sum. Mahomet now refused
to accept it, and, throwing dust on
the ungrateful churl, exclaimed, “Thus
shall thy wealth be scattered!” and the
man became poor again as fast as he had
grown rich.--<cite>Al Korân</cite>, ix. (Sale’s notes).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Thal´aba, the Destroyer</b>--that is, the
destroyer of the evil spirits of Dom-Daniel.
He was the only surviving child
of Hodei´rah (3 <i>syl.</i>), and his wife, Zeinab
(2 <i>syl.</i>); their other eight children had
been cut off by the Dom-Danielists, because
it had been decreed by fate that “one
of the race would be their destruction.”
When a mere stripling, Thalăba was left
motherless and fatherless (bk. i.); he then
found a home in the tent of a Bedouin
named Mo´ath, who had a daughter,
Onei´za (3 <i>syl.</i>). Here he was found by
Abdaldar, an evil spirit, sent from Dom-Daniel
to kill him; but the spirit was
killed by a simoom, just as he was about
to stab the boy, and Thalaba was saved
(bk. ii.). He now drew from the finger of
Abdaldar, the magic ring, which gave him
power over all spirits; and, thus armed,
he set out to avenge the death of his
<a id='corr91R.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='father”'>father</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_91R.28'><ins class='correction' title='father”'>father</ins></a></span> (bk. iii.). On his way to Babylon
he was encountered by a merchant, who
was in reality the sorcerer, Loba´ba, in
disguise. This sorcerer led Thalaba astray
into the wilderness, and then raised up a
whirlwind to destroy him; but the whirlwind
was the death of Lobaba himself,
and again Thalaba escaped (bk. iv.). He
reached Babylon at length, and met there
Mohāreb, another evil spirit, disguised as
a warrior, who conducted him to the
“mouth of hell.” Thalaba detected the
villainy, and hurled the false one into the
abyss (bk. v.). The young “Destroyer”
was next conveyed to “the paradise of
pleasure,” but he resisted every temptation,
and took to flight just in time to save
Oneiza, who had been brought there by
violence (bk. vi.). He then killed Aloa´din,
the presiding spirit of the garden,
with a club, was made vizier, and married
Oneiza, but she died on the bridal night
(bk. vii.). Distracted at this calamity, he
wandered towards Kâf, and entered the
house of an old woman, who was spinning
thread. Thalaba expressed surprise at
its extreme fineness, but Maimu´na (the
old woman) told him, fine as it was, he
could not break it. Thalaba felt incredulous,
and wound it round his wrists,
when, lo! he became utterly powerless;
and Maimuna, calling up her sister,
Khwala, conveyed him helpless to the
island of Moha´reb (bk. viii.). Here he
remained for a time, and was at length
liberated by Maimuna, who repented of her
sins, and turned to Allah (bk. ix.). Being
liberated from the island of Mohāreb, our
hero wandered, cold and hungry, into a
dwelling, where he saw Laila, the daughter
of Okba, the sorcerer. Okba rushed
forward with intent to kill him, but Laila
interposed, and fell dead by the hand of
her own father (bk. x.). Her spirit, in the
form of a green bird, now became the
guardian angel of “The Destroyer,” and
conducted him to the simorg, who directed
him the road to Dom-Daniel (bk. xi.),
which he reached in time, slew the surviving
sorcerers, and was received into heaven
(bk. xii.).--Southey, <cite>Thalaba, the Destroyer</cite>

told Sâleh, the prophet, that the
god which answered by miracle should be
acknowledged God by both. Jonda and
the Thamûdites first called upon their

said the prince to Sâleh, “if God will
bring a camel big with young from that
rock, we will believe.” Scarcely had he
spoken, when the rock groaned and shook
and opened; and forthwith there came a
camel, which there and then cast its young
one. Jonda became at once a convert, but
the Thamûdites held back. To add to the
miracle, the camel went up and down

A charming fiction, largely borrowed from

brigands met one morning on a hill near
the mouth of the Nile, and saw a vessel,
laden with stores, lying at anchor. They
also observed that the banks of the Nile
were strewn with dead bodies and the
fragments of food. On further examination
they beheld Charicleia sitting on a
rock, tending Theagĕnês, who lay beside
her severely wounded. Some pirates had
done it, and to them the vessel belonged.

history of Charicleia, her love for Theagenês,
and their capture by the pirates.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Thebaid</b> (<i>The</i>), a Latin epic poem in
twelve books, by Statius (about a century
after Virgil). Laïos, king of Thebes, was
told by an oracle that he would have a
son, but that his son would be his murderer.
To prevent this, when the son was
born he was hung on a tree by his feet, to
be devoured by wild beasts. The child,
however, was rescued by some of the royal
servants, who brought him up, and called
his name &OElig;dĭpos or Club-foot, because his
feet and ankles were swollen by the thongs.
One day, going to Thebes, the chariot of
Laïos nearly drove over the young &OElig;dipos;
a quarrel ensued, and Laïos was killed.
&OElig;dipos, not knowing whom he had slain,
went on to Thebes, and ere long married
the widowed queen, Jocasta, not knowing
that she was his mother, and by her he
had two sons and two daughters. The
names of the sons were Et´eoclês and
Polynīcês. These sons in time dethroned
their father, and agreed to reign alternate
years. Etĕŏclês reigned first, but at the
close of the year refused to resign the
crown to his brother, and Polynicês made
war upon him. This war, which occurred
some forty-two years before the siege of
Troy, and about the time that Debŏrah
was fighting with Sisĕra (<cite>Judges</cite> iv.), is the
subject of the <cite>Thebaid</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first book recapitulates the history
given above, and then goes on to say that
Polynicês went straight to Argos, and laid
his grievance before King Adrastos (bk.
i.). While at Argos he married one of the
king’s daughters, and Tydeus the other.
The festivities being over, Tydeus was
sent to Thebes to claim the throne for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>brother-in-law, and, being insolently dismissed,
denounced war against Eteoclês.
The villainous usurper sent fifty ruffians
to fall on the ambassador on his way to
Argos, but they were all slain, except one,
who was left to carry back the news (bk.
ii). When Tydeus reached Argos he
wanted his father-in-law to march at once
against Thebes, but Adrastos, less impetuous,
made answer that a great war
required time for its organization. How
ever, Kapăneus (3 <i>syl.</i>), siding with Tydeus
[<i>Ti´.duce</i>], roused the mob (bk. iii.), and
Adrastos at once set about preparations
for war. He placed his army under six
chieftains, viz., Polynicês, Tydeus, Amphiarāos,
Kapaneus, Parthenopæos and
Hippomĕdon, he himself acting as commander-in-chief
(bk. iv.). Bks. v., vi. describe
the march from Argos to Thebes.
On the arrival of the allied army before
Thebes, Jocasta tried to reconcile her two
sons, but, not succeeding in this, hostilities
commenced, and one of the chiefs,
named Amphiaraos, was swallowed up by
an earthquake (bk. vii.). Next day Tydeus
greatly distinguished himself, but
fell (bk. viii.). Hippomedon and Parthenopæos
were both slain the day following
(bk. ix.). Then came the turn of Kapaneus,
bold as a tiger, strong as a giant,
and a regular dare-devil in war. He actually
scaled the wall, he thought himself
sure of victory, he defied even Jove to stop
him, and was instantly killed by a flash of
lightning (bk. x.). Polynicês was now the
only one of the six remaining, and he sent
to Eteoclês to meet him in single combat.
The two brothers met, they fought like
lions, they gave no quarter, they took no
rest. At length Eteoclês fell, and Polynicês,
running up to strip him of his arms,
was thrust through the bowels, and fell
dead on the dead body of his brother.
Adrastos now decamped, and returned to
Argos (bk. xi.). Creon, having usurped
the Theban crown, forbade any one, on
pain of death, to bury the dead; but when
Theseus, king of Athens, heard of this
profanity, he marched at once to Thebes,
Creon died, and the crown was given to
Theseus (bk. xii.).</p>

grew hard by, and snubbed the oak, calling

complained to the lord of the field, and
prayed him to cut it down. The request
was obeyed, and the oak was felled; but
now the bramble suffered from the storm

snow bent it to the ground, where it was
draggled and defiled. The application is

has taken it no doubt has greater need of
it than either you or I.” (Reigned 1042-1066).</p>

At another time, one of the twelve poor
men in his train cut off a rich gold pendant
from the royal robe, and Robert, turning
to the man, said to him, “Hide it quickly,
friend, before any one sees it.” (Reigned

meet at the tomb of Ninus. Thisbê was
first at the trysting-place, but, being
scared by a lion, took to flight, and accidentally
dropped her robe, which the lion
tore and stained with blood. Pyramus,
seeing the blood-stained robe, thought
that the lion had eaten Thisbê, and so
killed himself. When Thisbê returned

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Symbolic.</span> (1) In the tabernacle and
Jewish Temple.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>Temple</em> consisted of three parts:
the porch, the Temple proper and the holy
of holies. It had three courts: the court
of the priests, the court of the people and
the court of foreigners. The innermost
court had three rows, and three windows
in each row (<cite>1 Kings</cite> vi. 36; vii. 4).</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly, Ezekiel’s city had three gates
on each side (<cite>Ezek.</cite> xlviii. 31). Cyrus left
direction for the rebuilding of the Temple;
it was to be three score cubits in height,
and three score cubits wide, and three
rows of great stones were to be set up
(<cite>Ezra</cite> vi. 3, 4). In like manner, the “New
Jerusalem” is to have four times three
foundations: (1) jasper, (2) sapphire, (3)
chalcedony, (4) emerald, (5) sardonyx, (6)
sardius, (7) chrysolyte, (8) beryl, (9) topaz,
(10) chrysoprase, (11) jacinth, (12) amethyst.
It is to have three gates fronting
each cardinal quarter (<cite>Rev.</cite> xxi. 13-20).</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) In the <cite>Temple Furniture</cite>: The golden
candlestick had three branches on each
side (<cite>Exod.</cite> xxv. 32); there were three
bowls (ver. 33); the height of the altar
was three cubits (<cite>Exod.</cite> xxvii. 1); there
were three pillars for the hangings (ver.
14); Solomon’s molten sea was supported
on oxen, three facing each cardinal point
(<cite>1 Kings</cite> vii. 25).</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) <em>Sacrifices and Offerings</em>: A meat
offering consisted of three-tenth deals of
fine flour (<cite>Lev.</cite> xiv. 10); Hannah offered
up three bullocks when Samuel was devoted
to the temple (<cite>1 Sam.</cite> i. 24); three
sorts of beasts--bullocks, rams, and lambs--were
appointed for offerings (<cite>Numb.</cite>
xxix.); the Jews were commanded to keep
three national feasts yearly (<cite>Exod.</cite>. xxiii.
14-17); in all criminal charges three witnesses
were required (<cite>Deut.</cite> xvii. 6).</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Miscellaneous Threes.</span> Joshua sent
three men from each tribe to survey the
land of Canaan (<cite>Josh.</cite> xvii. 4). Moses had
done the same at the express command of
God (<cite>Numb.</cite> xiii.). Job had three friends
(<cite>Job</cite> ii. 11). Abraham was accosted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>three men (angels), with whom he pleaded
to spare the cities of the plain (<cite>Gen.</cite> xviii.
2). Nebuchadnezzar cast three men into
the fiery furnace (<cite>Dan.</cite> iii. 24). David had
three mighty men of valor, and one of
them slew 300 of the Philistines with his
spear (<cite>2 Sam.</cite> xxiii. 9, 18). Nebuchadnezzar’s
image was three score cubits
high (<cite>Dan.</cite> iii. 1).  Moses was hidden
three months from the Egyptian police
(<cite>Exod.</cite> ii. 2). The ark of the covenant
was three months in the house of Obededom
(<cite>2 Sam.</cite> vi. 11). Balaam smote his
ass three times before the beast upbraided
him (<cite>Numb.</cite> xxii. 28).  Samson mocked
Delilah three times (<cite>Judges</cite> xvi. 15). Elijah
stretched himself three times on the
child which he restored to life (<cite>1 Kings</cite>
xvii. 21). The little horn plucked up three
horns by the roots (<cite>Dan.</cite> vii. 8). The bear
seen by Daniel in his vision, had three
ribs in its mouth (ver. 5). Joab slew Absalom
with three darts (<cite>2 Sam.</cite> xviii. 14).
God gave David the choice of three chastisements
(<cite>2 Sam.</cite> xxiv. 12). The great
famine in David’s reign lasted three years
(<cite>2 Sam.</cite> xxi. 1); so did the great drought
in Ahab’s reign (<cite>Luke</cite> iv. 25). There were
three men transfigured on the mount, and
three spectators (<cite>Matt.</cite> xvii. 1-4).  The
sheet was let down to Peter three times
(<cite>Acts</cite> x. 16). There are three Christian
graces: Faith, hope, and charity (<cite>1 Cor.</cite>
xiii. 13). There are three that bear record
in heaven, and three that bear witness on
earth (<cite>1 John</cite> v. 7, 8). There were three
unclean spirits that came out of the mouth
of the dragon (<cite>Rev.</cite> xvi. 13).</p>

<p class='c016'>A wonder is said to last three times
three days. The scourge used for criminals
is a “cat o’ nine tails.” Possession
is nine points of the law, being equal to
(1) money to make good a claim, (2) patience
to carry a suit through, (3) a good
cause, (4) a good lawyer, (5) a good counsel,
(6) good witnesses, (7) a good jury,
(8) a good judge, (9) good luck. Leases
used to be granted for 999 years. Ordeals
by fire consisted of three times three red-hot

David, and Judas Maccabæus; Hector,
Alexander, and Julius Cæsar; Arthur,
Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon.
The worthies of London are three times

<p class='c016'><b>Thresher</b> (<i>Captain</i>), the feigned leader
of a body of lawless Irishmen, who attacked,
in 1806, the collectors of tithes and
their subordinates.</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Right was a leader of the rebellious
peasantry in the south of Ireland in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Rock was the assumed name of
a leader of Irish insurgents in 1822.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Thrummy-Cap</b>, a sprite which figures
in the fairy tales of Northumberland. He
was a “queer-looking little auld man,”
whose scene of exploits generally lay in
the vaults and cellars of old castles. John
Skelton, in his <cite>Colyn Clout</cite>, calls him Tom-a-Thrum,
and says that the clergy could
neither write nor read, and were no wiser
than this cellar sprite.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Thrush</b> (<i>Song of the</i>). Marvellous, rippling
music, like the sweet babble of a
brook over stones; like the gentle sighing
of the wind in pine trees ... a rhapsody
impossible to describe, but constantly reminding
one of running streams and gentle
waterfalls, and coming nearer to “put my
woods in song” than any other bird-notes
whatever.--Olive Thorne Miller, <cite>In Nesting
Time</cite> (1888).</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Thrush</i> (<i>Golden-crowned</i>). Commencing
in a very low key ... he grows louder
and louder, till his body quakes, and his
chant runs into a shriek, ringing in my
ear with a peculiar sharpness. This lay
may be represented thus: “Teacher!
<em>teacher!</em> Teacher! <span class='sc'>Teacher!</span> TEACHER!”
the accent on the first syllable, and each
word uttered with increasing force and
shrillness.--John Burroughs, <cite>Wake Robin</cite>

<p class='c016'><b>Thu´le</b> (2 <i>syl.</i>), the most remote northern
portion of the world known to the
ancient Greeks and Romans; but whether
an island or part of a continent nobody
knows. It is first mentioned by Pythĕas,
the Greek navigator, who says it is “six
days’ sail from Britain,” and that its climate
is a “mixture of earth, air and sea.”
Ptolemy, with more exactitude, tells us
that the 63° of north latitude runs through
the middle of Thulê, and adds that “the
days there are at the equinoxes [<em>sic</em>]
twenty-four hours long.” This, of course,
is a blunder, but the latitude would do
roughly for Iceland.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>(No place has a day of twenty-four hours
long at either equinox; but anywhere beyond
either polar circle the day is twenty-four

<p class='c016'><i>Thule</i> (2 <i>syl.</i>). Antonius Diogenês, a
Greek, wrote a romance on “The Incredible
Things beyond Thulê” (<cite>Ta huper
Thoulen Apista</cite>), which has furnished the
basis of many subsequent tales. The work
is not extant, but Photius gives an outline
of its contents in his <cite>Bibliotheca</cite>.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Thumb</b> (<i>Tom</i>), a dwarf no bigger than
a man’s thumb. He lived in the reign of
King Arthur, by whom he was knighted.
He was the son of a common ploughman,
and was killed by the poisonous breath of
a spider in the reign of Thunstone, the
successor of King Arthur.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amongst his adventures may be mentioned
the following:--He was lying one
day asleep in a meadow, when a cow swallowed
him as she cropped the grass. At
another time he rode in the ear of a horse.
He crept up the sleeve of a giant, and so
tickled him that he shook his sleeve, and
Tom, falling into the sea, was swallowed

<p class='c016'>N.B.--“Great Britain” was not a recognized
term till 1701 (Queen Anne), when
the two parliaments of Scotland and England
were united. Before that time, England
was called “South Britain,” Scotland
“North Britain,” and Brittany “Little
Britain.” The date, 1630, would carry us
back to the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fielding, in 1730, wrote a burlesque
opera called <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>, which was altered
in 1778, by Kane O’Hara. Dr. Arne
wrote the music to it, and his “daughter
(afterwards Mrs. Cibber), then only 14,
acted the part of ‘Tom Thumb’ at the
Haymarket Theatre.”--T. Davies, <cite>Life of
Garrick</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Here again the dates do not correctly
fit in. Mrs. Cibber was born in 1710, and
must have been 20 when Fielding produced
his opera of <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>.</p>

in 1832, and died in January,

<p class='c001'>1. Thyestês seduced the wife of his
brother, Atreus (2 <i>syl.</i>), for which he was
banished. In his banishment he carried
off his brother’s son, Plisthĕnês, whom he
brought up as his own child. When the
boy was grown to manhood, he sent him
to assassinate Atreus, but Atreus slew
Plisthenês, not knowing him to be his
son. The corresponding vengeance was
this: Thyestês had a son named. Ægisthos,
who was brought up by King Atreus
as his own child. When Ægisthos was
grown to manhood, the king sent him to
assassinate Thyestês, but the young man
slew Atreus instead.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Atreus slew his own son, Plisthenês,
thinking him to be his brother’s child.
When he found out his mistake, he pretended
to be reconciled to his brother,
and asked him to a banquet. Thyestês
went to the feast, and ate part of his own
two sons, which had been cooked, and
were set before him by his brother.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Thyestês defiled the wife of his
brother, Atreus, and Atreus married Pelopia,
the unwedded wife of his brother,
Thyestês. It was the son of this woman
by Thyestês who murdered Atreus (his
uncle and father-in-law).</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ The tale of Atreus and that of
&OElig;dĭpus are the two most lamentable
stories of historic fiction, and in some
points resemble each other: Thus &OElig;dipus
married his mother, not knowing
who she was; Thyestês seduced his
daughter, not knowing who she was.
&OElig;dipus slew his father, not knowing who
he was; Atreus slew his son, not knowing
who he was. &OElig;dipus was driven
from his throne by the sons born to him
by his own mother; Atreus [<i>At´.ruce</i>]
was killed by the natural son of his own
wife.</p>

a peer. He took off his hat to every man

pinched up with peculiar smartness; his
looks were pale, thin, and sharp, round
his neck he wore a broad black ribbon, and
in his bosom a glass pin; his coat was
trimmed with tarnished lace; and his
stockings were silk. Beau Tibbs interlarded
his rapid talk with fashionable
oaths, such as, “Upon my soul! egad!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was asked to dine yesterday,” he says, “at

Ned then asked his wife if she had given
orders for dinner. “You need make no

This Luria is far too noble to do, but he
grants Tiburzio his liberty. Tiburzio, being
examined by the council of Florence,
under the hope of finding some cause of
censure against the Moor, to lessen or cancel
their obligations to him, “testifies to

Feast of the Annunciation, to any who
chose to apply for it. Sir Roger, her husband,
said he would give her as much
land as she could walk over while a billet
of wood remained burning. The old lady
was taken into the park, and managed to
crawl over twenty-three acres of land,
which was accordingly set apart, and is
called “The Crawls” to this hour. When
the Lady Mabella was taken back to her

prosper; but immediately it is discontinued,
the house shall fall, from the failure
of an heir male. This,” she added,
“will be when a family of seven sons is

enough, the baron had seven sons

title, <cite>The Times</cite>, remained. In 1803,
John Walter, son of the founder, became
manager, and greatly improved the character
of the paper, and in 1814 introduced
a steam press. He died in 1847, and was
succeeded by his son, John Walter III.
In the editorial department, John (afterwards
“Sir John”) Stoddart (nicknamed
“Dr. Slop”), who began to write political
articles in <cite>The Times</cite> in 1810, was appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>editor in 1812, but, in 1816, was
dismissed for his rabid hatred of Napoleon.
He tried to establish an opposition
journal, <cite>The New Times</cite>, which proved an
utter failure. Sir John Stoddart was succeeded
by John Stebbing; then followed
Thomas Barnes (“Mr. T. Bounce”), who
remained editor till his death, in 1841.
W. F. A. Delane came next, and continued
till 1858, when his son, John Thaddeus
Delane, succeeded him. The following

see him fall, ran to his succor, applied an
ointment to his wounds, and bound them

eyes, exclaimed, “Angel or goddess; do I

maid, “but only a wood-nymph.” Then
was he set upon his horse and taken to
Belph&oelig;bê’s pavilion, where he soon “recovered
from his wounds, but lost his
heart” (bk. iii. 6). In bk. iv. 7 Belph&oelig;bê
subsequently found Timias in dalliance
with Amoret, and said to him, “Is this
thy faith?” She said no more, “but
turned her face and fled.” This is an allusion
to Sir Walter Raleigh’s amour with
Elizabeth Throgmorton (<cite>Amoret</cite>), one of
the queen’s maids of honor, which drew

This dog has been stolen in youth from another

suspicion that it lurks in others; but Toby, entertaining
a grateful recollection of his old master,
and scorning to attach himself to any new
patron, not only refuses to smoke a pipe at the

<p class='c016'><i>Tom Thumb</i>, a burlesque opera, altered
by Kane O’Hara (author of <cite>Midas</cite>), in
1778, from a dramatic piece by Fielding,
the novelist (1730). Tom Thumb, having
killed the giants, falls in love with Huncamunca,
daughter of King Arthur. Lord
Grizzle wishes to marry the princess, and
when he hears that the “pygmy giant-queller”
is preferred before him, his lordship
turns traitor, invests the palace “at
the head of his rebellious rout,” and is
slain by Tom. Then follows the bitter
end: A red cow swallows Tom, the queen,
Dollallolla, kills Noodle, Frizaletta kills
the queen, Huncamunca kills Frizaletta,
Doodle kills Huncamunca, Plumantê kills
Doodle, and the king, being left alone,
stabs himself. Merlin now enters, commands
the red cow to “return our England’s
Hannibal,” after which the wise
wizard restores all the slain ones to life
again, and thus “jar ending,” each resolves
to go home “and make a night on’t.”</p>

in the windows, and with no plank or
beam that had not rotted or fallen away.
There was a slough of water, a leafless tree
or two, and plenty of filth. Rumor said
that Tom Mopes had murdered his beautiful
wife from jealousy, and had abandoned
the world. Mr. Traveller tried to
reason with him, and bring him back to
social life, but the tinker replied, “When

wait till I return.” “But, sire,” pleaded
the widow, “if you do not return, who
will grant me justice?” “My successor,”
said Trajan. “And can Trajan leave to
another the duty that he himself is appointed
to perform?” On hearing this
the emperor stopped his cavalcade, heard
the woman’s cause, and granted her suit.

<p class='c001'>Dion Cassius (<cite>Roman Historia</cite>, lxix.)
tells the same story of Hadrian. When a
woman appeared before him with a suit
as he was starting on a journey, the
emperor put her off, saying, “I have no
leisure now.” She replied, “If Hadrian
has no leisure to perform his duties, let
him cease to reign!” On hearing this reproof
he dismounted from his horse and
gave ear to the woman’s cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>A woman once made her appeal to
Philip of Macedon, who, being busy at the
time, petulantly exclaimed, “Woman, I
have no time now for such matters.” “If
Philip has no time to render justice,” said
the woman, “then it is high time for Philip
to resign!” The king felt the rebuke,
heard the cause patiently, and decided it
justly.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Transformations.</b> In the art of transformation,
one of the most important
things was a ready wit to adopt in an instant
some form which would give you an
advantage over your adversary; thus, if
your adversary appeared as a mouse, you
must change into an owl, then your adversary
would become an arrow to shoot
the owl, and you would assume the form
of fire to burn the arrow, whereupon your
adversary would become water to quench
the fire; and he who could outwit the
other would come off victorious. The two
best examples I know of this sort of contest
are to be found, one in the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>, and the other in the <cite>Mabinogion</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The former is the contest between the
Queen of Beauty and the son of the daughter
of Eblis. He appeared as a scorpion,
she in a moment became a serpent; whereupon
he changed into an eagle, she into
a more powerful black eagle; he became
a cat, she a wolf; she instantly changed
into a worm and crept into a pomegranite,
which in time burst, whereupon he assumed
the form of a cock to devour the
seed, but it became a fish; the cock then
became a pike, but the princess became a
blazing fire, and consumed her adversary
before he had time to change.--“The
Second Calendar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The other is the contest between Caridwen
and Gwion Bach. Bach fled as a
hare, she changed into a greyhound;
whereupon he became a fish, she an otter-bitch,
he instantly became a bird, she a
hawk; but he became as quick as thought
a grain of wheat. Caridwen now became
a hen, and made for the wheat-corn and
devoured him.--“Taliesin.”</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Traveller</b> (<i>The</i>). The scheme of this
poem is very simple: The poet supposes
himself seated among Alpine solitudes,
looking down upon a hundred kingdoms.
He would fain find some spot where happiness
can be attained, but the natives of
each realm think their own the best; yet
the amount of happiness in each is pretty
well equal. To illustrate this, the poet describes
the manners and government of
Italy, Switzerland, France, Holland, and
England.--O. Goldsmith (1764).</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of the discovery of America
by Columbus, many marvellous tales were
rife in Spain. It was said that in one
part of the coast of El Nombre de Dios,
the natives had such long ears that one ear
served for bed and the other for counterpane.
This reminds one of Gwevyl mab
Gwestad, one of whose lips hung down to
his waist, and the other covered his head
like a cowl. Another tale was that one of
the crew of Columbus had come across a
people who lived on sweet scents alone,
and were killed by foul smells. This invention
was hardly original, inasmuch as
both Plutarch and Pliny tell us of an Indian
people who lived on sweet odors, and
Democrĭtos lived for several days on the
mere effluvia of hot bread. Another tale
was that the noses of these smell-feeders
were so huge that their heads were all
nose. We are also told of one-eyed men;
of men who carried their heads under one
of their arms; of others whose head was
in their breast; of others who were conquered,
not by arms, but by their priests
holding up before them a little ivory
crucifix--a sort of Christian version of
the taking of Jericho by the blast of the
rams’ horns of the Levites in the time of
Joshua.</p>

having been meanly treated by his elder

<p class='c016'><b>Tripping as an Omen.</b></p>

<p class='c001'>When Julius Cæsar landed at Adrumētum,
in Africa, he happened to trip and
fall on his face. This would have been
considered a fatal omen by his army, but,
with admirable presence of mind, he exclaimed,
“Thus take I possession of thee,
O Africa!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A similar story is told of Scipio. Upon
his arrival in Africa, he also happened to
trip, and, observing that his soldiers
looked upon this as a bad omen, he
clutched the earth with his two hands,
and cried aloud, “Now, Africa, I hold thee
in my grasp!”--<cite>Don Quixote</cite>, II. iv. 6.</p>

<p class='c001'>When William the Conqueror leaped on
shore at Bulverhythe, he fell on his face,
and a great cry went forth that the omen
was unlucky; but the duke exclaimed, “I
take seisin of this land with both my

<p class='c001'>The same story is told of Napoleon in
Egypt; of King Olaf, son of Harald, in

<p class='c016'><b>Tristram</b> (<i>Sir</i>), son of Sir Meliŏdas,
king of Li´onês, and Elizabeth, his wife
(daughter of Sir Mark, king of Cornwall).
He was called Tristram (“sorrowful”) because
his mother died in giving him birth.
His father also died when Tristram was a
mere lad (pt. ii. 1). He was knighted by
his uncle, Mark (pt. ii. 5), and married
Isond <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>le Blanch Mains</em></span>, daughter of Howell,
king of Britain (<em>Brittany</em>); but he
never loved her, nor would he live with
her. His whole love was centered on his
aunt, La Belle Isond, wife of King Mark,
and this unhappy attachment was the
cause of numberless troubles, and ultimately
of his death. La Belle Isond, however,
was quite as culpable as the knight,
for she herself told him, “My measure of
hate for Mark is as the measure of my
love for thee;” and when she found out
that her husband would not allow Sir
Tristram to remain at Tintag´il Castle, she
eloped with him, and lived three years at
Joyous Guard, near Carlisle. At length
she returned home, and Sir Tristram followed
her. His death is variously related.
Thus the <cite>History of Prince Arthur</cite> says:</p>

<p class='c018'>When, by means of a treaty, Sir Tristram
brought again La Belle Isond unto King Mark
from Joyous Guard, the false traitor, King
Mark, slew the noble knight as he sat harping
before his lady, La Belle Isond, with a sharp-ground
glaive, which he thrust into him from
behind his back.--Pt. iii. 147 (1470).</p>

<p class='c016'>Tennyson gives the tale thus: He says
that Sir Tristram, dallying with his aunt,
hung a ruby carcanet round her throat;
and, as he kissed her neck:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,</div>

      <div class='line in12'>Tennyson, <cite>Idylls</cite> (“The Last Tournament”).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Another tale is this: Sir Tristram was
severely wounded in Brittany, and sent
a dying request to his aunt to come and
see him. If she consented, a white flag
was to be hoisted on the mast-head of her
ship; if not, a black one. His wife told
him the ship was in sight, displaying a
black flag, at which words the strong man
bowed his head and died. When his aunt
came ashore and heard of his death, she
flung herself on the body, and died also.
The two were buried in one grave, and
Mark planted over it a rose and a vine,
which became so interwoven it was not
possible to separate them.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram and Sir
Lamorake were the three bravest and best
of the 150 knights of the Round Table,
but were all equally guilty in their amours:
Sir Launcelot with the queen; Sir Tristram
with his aunt, King Mark’s wife;

very humorous, and somewhat coarse.

bullet head, and his close-shaven crown
was edged with thick, stiff, curly black
hair. His countenance was bluff and
jovial, eyebrows black and bushy, forehead
well-turned, cheeks round and ruddy,
beard long, curly and black, form brawny
(ch. xv.).</p>

with gold twist and a golden tassel.
At his girdle hung a wallet for the reception

no other food but what they received from
begging. Friar Tuck was chaplain to
Robin Hood, the May-king. (See <span class='sc'>Morris-Dance</span>.)</p>

This fiction was declared authentic

in 1122, but it is now generally attributed
to a canon of Barcelona in the eleventh

<p class='c001'>The tale says that Charlemagne went to
Spain in 777 to defend one of his allies
from the aggressions of a neighboring
prince. Having conquered Navarre and
Aragon he returned to France. He then
crossed the Pyrenees, and invested Pampeluna
for three months, but without success.
He tried the effect of prayer, and
the walls, like those of Jericho, fell down
of their own accord. Those Saracens who
consented to be baptized he spared, but
the rest were put to the sword. Being
master of Pampeluna, the hero visited the
sarcophagus of James; and Turpin, who
accompanied him, baptized most of the
neighborhood. Charlemagne then led back
his army over the Pyrenees, the rear being
under the command of Roland. The main
army reached France in safety, but 50,000
Saracens fell on the rear, and none escaped.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Twelfth Night</b>, a drama by Shakespeare.
The story came originally from
a novellette by Bandello (who died 1555),
reproduced by Belleforest in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoires
Tragiques</cite></span>, from which Shakespeare obtained
his story. The tale is this: Viola
and Sebastian were twins, and exactly
alike. When grown up, they were ship-wrecked
off the coast of Illyria, and both
were saved. Viola, being separated from
her brother, in order to obtain a livelihood,
dressed like her brother, and took
the situation of page under the duke Orsino.
The duke, at the time, happened
to be in love with Olivia, and as the lady
looked coldly on his suit, he sent Viola to
advance it, but the willful Olivia, instead
of melting towards the duke, fell in love
with his beautiful page. One day Sebastian,
the twin-brother of Viola, being attacked
in a street brawl, before Olivia’s
house, the lady, thinking him to be the
page, invited him in, and they soon grew
to such familiar terms that they agreed to
become man and wife. About the same
time, the duke discovered his page to be
a beautiful woman, and as he could not
marry his first love, he made Viola his
wife, and the duchess of Illyria.</p>

warriors in Charlemagne’s court.</p>

<p class='c001'>1. <span class='sc'>Astolpho</span>, cousin of Roland, descended
from Charles Martel. A great
boaster, fool-hardy, and singularly handsome.
It was Astolpho who went to the
moon to fetch back Orlando’s (<em>Roland’s</em>)
brains when mad.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. <span class='sc'>Ferumbras</span> or <span class='sc'>Fierabras</span>, a Saracen,

or Orlando.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. <span class='sc'>Ganelon</span>, the traitor, count of Mayence.
Placed by Dantê in the Inferno.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. <span class='sc'>Maugris</span>, in Italian <span class='sc'>Malagigi</span>, cousin
to Rinaldo, and son of Beuves of Aygremont.
He was brought up by Oriande
the fairy, and became a great enchanter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>6. <span class='sc'>Namo</span> or <span class='sc'>Nayme</span> de Bavière.</p>

<p class='c001'>7. <span class='sc'>Ogier</span>, the <span class='sc'>Dane</span>, thought to be Holger,
the hero of Denmark, but some affirm
that “Dane” is a corruption of <em>Damné</em>;
so called because he was not baptized.</p>

<p class='c001'>8. <span class='sc'>Oliver</span>, son of Regnier, comte de
Gennes, the rival of Roland in all feats of
arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>9. <span class='sc'>Otuel</span>, a Saracen, nephew to Ferragus
or Ferracute. He was converted, and
married a daughter of King Charlemagne.</p>

<p class='c001'>10. <span class='sc'>Rinaldo</span>, son of Duke Aymon, and
cousin to Roland. Angelica fell in love
with him, but he requited not her affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>11. <span class='sc'>Roland</span>, called <span class='sc'>Orlando</span> in Italian,
comte de Cenouta.  He was Charlemagne’s
nephew, his mother being Berthe,
the king’s sister, and his father Millon.</p>

<p class='c001'>12. One of the following names, all of
which are called paladins, and probably

each case there were three pre-eminent for
bravery: Oliver, Roland and Rinaldo

was a Saracen: Ferumbras (<em>the paladin</em>);
Palomides (<em>the Table knight</em>). In each was
a traitor: Ganelon (<em>the paladin</em>); Mordred
(<em>the Table Knight</em>), like Judas Iscariot in

sojourn in Milan, and there fell in love
with Silvia, the duke’s daughter, who was

being sent by his father to Milan,
forgot Julia, fell in love with Silvia, and,
in order to carry his point, induced the
duke to banish Valentine, who became
the captain of banditti, into whose hands
Silvia fell. Julia, unable to bear the absence
of her lover, dressed in boy’s clothes,
and, going to Milan, hired herself as a
page to Protheus, and when Silvia was
lost, the duke, with Thurio, Protheus and
his page, went in quest of her. She was
soon discovered, but when Thurio attempted
to take possession of her, Valentine
said to him, “I dare you to touch
her;” and Thurio replied, “None but a
fool would fight for a girl.” The duke,
disgusted, gave Silvia to Valentine; and

in the reign of Kaiser Henry IV. He
promised to avenge his lord and master,
who had been plundered by Count Adalbert,

water. The porter brought him a cup of
wine, and Tycho said, “Thank thy lord
for his charity, and tell him he shall meet
with his reward.” Then, returning home,
he procured thirty large wine-barrels, in
each of which he concealed an armed retainer
and weapons for two others. Each
cask was then carried by two men to the
count’s castle, and when the door was
opened Tycho said to the porter, “I am
come to recompense thy lord and master,”

by Thomas Murner, a Franciscan monk,
of Strasbourg (1475-1536); the English

Tyll is a mechanic of Brunswick, who runs
from pillar to post as charlatan, physician,
lansquenet, fool, valet, and Jack-of-all-trades.
He undertakes anything and
everything, but invariably “spoils the
Egyptians” who trust in him. He produces
popular proverbs, is brimfull of
merry mischief, droll as Sam Slick, indifferent
honest as Gil Blas, light-hearted as
Andrew Bode, as full of tricks as Scapin,
and as popular as Robin Hood. The book
is crammed with observations, anecdotes,
fables, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bon mots</em></span>, facetiæ, and shows forth
the omnipotence of common sense. There
are two good English versions of this
popular picaresco romance--one printed
by William Copland, and entitled <cite>The
Merrye Jeste of a Man called Howlëglass
and the many Marvellous Thinges and Jestes
which he did in his Lyfe in Eastland</cite>; and
the other published in 1860, translated by

represents him as being craftily wise and
full of devices. Virgil ascribes to him the

<p class='c016'><b>Ulysses and Polyphemos.</b></p>

<p class='c001'>Ulysses and his crew, having reached
the island of Sicily, strayed into the cave
of Polyphēmos, the giant Cyclops. Soon
as the monster returned and saw the
strangers, he seized two of them, and, having
dashed out their brains, made his supper
off them, “nor entrails left, nor yet
their marrowy bones;” then stretched he
his huge carcass on the floor, and went to
sleep. Next morning he caught up two
others, devoured them for his breakfast,
then stalked forth into the open air, driving
his flocks before him. At sun-down
he returned, seized other two for his supper
and after quaffing three bowls of wine,
fell asleep. Then it was that Ulysses
bored out the giant’s eye with a green
olive stake heated in the fire. The monster
roared with pain, and after searching
in vain to seize some of his tormentors, removed
the rock from the mouth of the cave
to let out his goats and sheep. Ulysses
and his companions escaped at the same
time by attaching themselves to the bellies
of the sheep, and made for their ship.
Polyphemos hurled rocks at the vessel,
and nearly succeeded in sinking it, but the
fugitives made good their flight, and the
blinded monster was left lamenting.--Homer,
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, ix.</p>

<p class='c001'>⁂ An extraordinary parallel to this tale
is told in the third voyage of Sindbad, the
sailor. Sindbad’s vessel was driven by a
tempest to an island of pygmies, and advancing
into the interior, the crew came
to a “high palace,” into which they entered.
At sundown came home the giant,
“tall as a palm tree; and in the middle of
his forehead was one eye, red and fiery as
a burning coal.” Soon as he saw the intruders,
he caught up the fattest of them
and roasted him for his supper, then lay
down to sleep, and “snored louder than
thunder.” At daybreak he left the palace,
but at night returned, and made his meal
off another of the crew. This was repeated
a third night, but while the monster
slept, Sindbad, with a red-hot spit,
scooped out his eye. “The pain he suffered
made him groan hideously,” and he
fumbled about the palace to catch some of
his tormentors “on whom to glut his
rage;” but not succeeding in this, he left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the palace, “bellowing with pain.” Sindbad
and the rest lost no time in making
for the sea; but scarcely had they pushed
off their rafts when the giant approached
with many others, and hurled huge stones
at the fugitives. Some of them even ventured
into the sea up to their waists, and
every raft was sunk except the one on
which Sindbad and two of his companions
made their escape.--<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> (“Sindbad,
the Sailor,” third voyage).</p>

<p class='c001'>Another similar tale occurs in the
Basque legends, in which the giant’s name
is Tartaro, and his eye was bored out with
spits made red hot. As in the previous
instances, some seamen had inadvertently
wandered into the giant’s dwelling, and
Tartaro had banqueted on three of them,
when his eye was scooped out by the
leader. This man, like Ulysses, made his
escape by means of a ram, but, instead of
clinging to the ram’s belly, he fastened
round his neck the ram’s bell, and
threw over his back a sheep-skin. When
Tartaro laid his hand on the skin, the
man left it behind and made good his
escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>That all these tales are borrowed from
one source none can doubt. The <cite>Iliad</cite> of
Homer had been translated into Syriac by
Theophilus Edessenes, a Christian Maronite
monk of Mount Libănus, during
the caliphate of Hárun-ur-Ráshid (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>

<p class='c016'><i>Ursula</i> (<i>Saint</i>), daughter of Dianotus,
king of Cornwall (brother and successor
of Caradoc, king of Cornwall). She was
asked in marriage by Conan [Meriadoc] of
Armorica, or Little Britain. Going to
France with her maidens, the princess was
driven by adverse winds to Cologne, where
she and “her 11,000 virgins” were martyred
by the Huns and Picts (October 21,
237). Visitors to Cologne are still shown
piles of skulls and bones heaped in the
wall, faced with glass, which the verger
asserts to be the relics of the martyred
virgins; but, like Iphis, they must have
changed their sex since death for most
undoubtedly many of the bones are those
of men and boys.--See Geoffrey, <cite>British
History</cite>, v. 15, 16.</p>

<p class='c001'>A calendar in the Freisingen Codex notices
them as “SS. XI. M. VIRGINUM”
<i>i.e.</i>, “eleven holy virgin martyrs;” but, by
making the “M” into a Roman figure
equal 1000, we have XIM=11,000; so
iiic=300.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ursula is the Swabian <em>ursul</em> or <em>hörsel</em>
(“the moon”), and, if this solution is accepted,
then the “virgins who bore her
company” are the stars. Ursul is the
Scandinavian Hulda.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who assert the legend to be based
on a fact, have supplied the following
names as the most noted of the virgins,
and, as there are but eleven given, it favors
the Freisingen Codex:--(1) Ursula, (2)
Sencia or Sentia, (3) Gregoria, (4) Pinnosa,
(5) Mardia, (6) Saula, (7) Brittola,

<p class='c016'><b>Use of Pests.</b> David once said he
could not image why a wise deity should
have created such things as spiders, idiots,
and mosquitoes; but his life showed they
were all useful to him at any rate. Thus,
when he fled from Saul, a spider spun its

feeling assured that the fugitive could not

the web, passed on without further search.
Again, when he was taken captive before
the king of Gath, he feigned idiocy, and
the king dismissed him, for he could not
believe such a driveller could be the great
champion who had slain Goliath. Once
more, when he entered into the tent of
Saul, as he was crawling along, Abner, in
his sleep, tossed his legs over him. David
could not stir, but a mosquito happened

<p class='c016'><i>Vanity Fair</i>, a novel by W. M. Thackeray
(1848). Becky (Rebecca) Sharp, the
daughter of a poor painter, dashing, selfish,
unprincipled, and very clever, contrives
to marry Rawdon Crawley, afterwards his
excellency Colonel Crawley, C.B., governor
of Coventry Island. Rawdon expected
to have a large fortune left him by
his aunt, Miss Crawley, but was disinherited
on account of his marriage with
Becky, then a poor governess. Becky
contrives to live in splendor on “nothing
a year,” gets introduced at court, and is
patronized by Lord Steyne, earl of Gaunt;
but, this intimacy giving birth to a great
scandal, Becky breaks up her establishment,
and is reduced to the lowest Bohemian
life. Afterwards she becomes the
“female companion” of Joseph Sedley, a
wealthy “collector,” of Boggley Wollah, in
India. Having insured his life and lost
his money, he dies suddenly under very
suspicions circumstances, and Becky lives
for a time in splendor on the Continent.
Subsequently she retires to Bath, where
she assumes the character of a pious, charitable
Lady Bountiful, given to all good
works. The other part of the story is
connected with Amelia Sedley, daughter
of a wealthy London stock-broker, who
fails, and is reduced to indigence. Captain
George Osborne, the son of a London
merchant, marries Amelia, and old Osborne
disinherits him. The young people
live for a time together, when George is
killed in the battle of Waterloo. Amelia
is reduced to great poverty, but is befriended
by Captain Dobbin, who loves
her to idolatry, and after many years of
patience and great devotion, she consents
to marry him. Becky Sharp rises from
nothing to splendor, and then falls; Amelia
falls from wealth to indigence, and
then rises.</p>

Edward VI. he was <b>calvanist</b>; in the reign

<p class='c001'>⁂ The song called <cite>The Vicar of Bray</cite>
was written in the reign of George I., by
Colonel Fuller, or an officer in Fuller’s regiment,
and does not refer to Alleyn, Pendleton,
or Symonds, but to some real or
imaginary person, who was vicar of Bray,
from Charles II. to George I. The first
verse begins: “In good King Charles’s

Ver. 2: “When royal James obtained
the crown,” I found the Church of
Rome would fit my constitution. Ver. 3:
“When William was our king declared,”
I swore to him allegiance. Ver. 4: “When

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><b>Vicar of Wakefield</b> (<i>The</i>), Dr. Primrose,
a simple-minded, pious clergyman,
with six children. He begins life with a
good fortune, a handsome house, and
wealthy friends, but is reduced to utter
poverty without any fault of his own, and,
being reduced like Job, like Job he is restored.
First, he loses his fortune through
the rascality of the merchant who held it.
His next great sorrow was the elopement
of his eldest daughter, Olivia, with Squire
Thornhill. His third was the entire destruction
by fire of his house, furniture
and books, together with the savings which
he had laid by for his daughters’ marriage
portions. His fourth was being incarcerated
in the county jail by Squire Thornhill
for rent, his wife and family being
driven out of house and home. His fifth
was the announcement that his daughter,
Olivia, “was dead,” and that his daughter,
Sophia, had been abducted. His sixth
was the imprisonment of his eldest son,
George, for sending a challenge to Squire
Thornhill. His cup of sorrow was now
full, and comfort was at hand: (1) Olivia
was not really dead, but was said to be so
in order to get the vicar to submit to the
squire, and thus obtain his release. (2) His
daughter, Sophia, had been rescued by
Mr. Burchell (<em>Sir William Thornhill</em>), who
asked her hand in marriage. (3) His son,
George, was liberated from prison, and
married Miss Wilmot, an heiress. (4)
Olivia’s marriage to the squire, which was
said to have been informal, was shown to
be legal and binding. (5) The old vicar
was released, re-established in his vicarage,
and recovered a part of his fortune.--Goldsmith,

possessing little for himself, yet ready to make
that little less, whenever misery appeals to his
compassion. With enough of worldly vanity
about him to show that he shares the weakness

him the duties of a wife. Angelo’s neglect
of her was “a civil divorce,” which would
have been a “sin” if the Church had sanctified
the union, but which, till then, was
only a moral or civil offence. Mariana
also considered herself Angelo’s “wife,”

He married Rowen’a, daughter of Hengist,
and was burnt to death in a tower set on

<cite>British History</cite>, vi. 6; viii. 1 (1142).</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Vortigern</i>, a drama put forward by
Henry W. Ireland (1796) as a newly discovered
play by Shakespeare. It was
brought out at Drury Lane Theatre, by
John Kemble. Dr. Parr declared it to be
his opinion that the play was genuine.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Vortigern and Hengist.</b> The account
of the massacre of the Long-Knives, given
by Geoffrey, in his <cite>British History</cite>, vi. 15,
differs greatly from that of the <cite>Welsh
Triads</cite> (See <span class='sc'>Stonehenge</span>, <span class='sc'>a Trophy</span>).
Geoffrey says that Hengist came over with
a large army, at which King Vortigern
was alarmed. To allay this suspicion,
Hengist promised to send back all the men
that the king did not require, and begged
Vortigern to meet him in conference at
Ambrius (<cite>Ambresbury</cite>), on May-day. Hengist,
in the meantime, secretly armed a
number of his soldiers with “long-knives,”
and told them to fall on the Britons during
the conference, when he uttered the
words, “Nemet oure Saxas.” This they
did, and 460 “barons and consuls” fell.
It does not appear from this narrative that
the slaughter was due “to the treachery
of Vortigern,” but was wholly the work
of Hengist. Geoffrey calls the earl of
Gloucester “Eldol,” and not “Eidiol.”</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Vortigern’s Tower</b>, like Penelopê’s
web, is a work ever beginning, and never
ending. Vortigern was told by his magicians

to build one on Mount Erir, but whatever
they built one day, was wholly swallowed
up by the earth during the night.--Geoffrey,

struck Him, saying, “Get on faster!”

<p class='c016'><b>Way of the World</b> (<i>The</i>), a comedy by
W. Congreve (1700). The “way of the
world” is to tie up settlements to wives,
to prevent their husbands squandering
their wives’ fortunes. Thus, Fainall
wanted to get into his power the fortune
of his wife, whom he hated, but found it
was “in trust to Edward Mirabell,” and
consequently could not be tampered with.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Way to Keep Him</b> (<i>The</i>), a comedy
by A. Murphy (1760). The object of this
drama is to show that women, after marriage,
should not wholly neglect their husbands,
but should try to please them, and
make home agreeable and attractive. The
chief persons are Mr. and Mrs. Lovemore.
Mr. Lovemore has a virtuous and excellent
wife, whom he esteems and loves;
but, finding his home insufferably dull, he
seeks amusement abroad; and those passions
which have no play at home lead
him to intrigue and card-playing, routes
and dubious society. The under-plot is
this: Sir Bashful Constant is a mere imitator
of Mr. Lovemore, and Lady Constant
suffers neglect from her husband and insult
from his friends, because he foolishly
thinks it is not <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>comme il faut</em></span> to love after
he has married the woman of his choice.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Ways and Means</b>, a comedy by Colman,

Harriet and Kitty, daughters of Sir David
Dunder, and fall in love with them. They
come to Dover, and accidentally meet Sir
David, who invites them over to Dunder
Hall, where they are introduced to the
two young ladies. Harriet is to be married
next day, against her will, to Lord
Snolts, a stumpy, “gummy” nobleman of
five and forty; and, to avoid this hateful
match, she and her sister agree to elope at
night with the two young guests. It so
happens that a series of blunders in the
dark occur, and Sir David himself becomes
privy to the whole plot, but, to prevent
scandal, he agrees to the two marriages,
and discovers that the young men, both
in family and fortune, are quite suitable
to be his sons-in-law.</p>

and whoever was last able to blow it, was
to be considered the “Champion of the

by Sir Robert Laurie, of Maxwelton,
who, after three days’ and three

the table, and “blew on the whistle his

desirous of obtaining some fairy fruit,

the new-born child was carried to the
fairies. When of marriageable age, the
fairies wanted her to marry Migonnet, a
fairy-dwarf, and, as she refused to do so,
changed her into a white cat. Now comes
the second part. An old king had three
sons, and promised to resign the kingdom
to that son who brought him the smallest
dog. The youngest son wandered to a
palace, where he saw a white cat endowed
with human speech, who gave him a dog
so tiny that the prince carried it in an acorn
shell. The father then said he would resign
his crown to that son who brought
him home a web, 400 yards long, which
would pass through the eye of a needle.
The White Cat gave the prince a web 400
yards long packed in the shale of a millet
grain. The king then told his sons he
would resign his throne to that son who
brought home the handsomest bride. The
White Cat told the prince to cut off its

resumed her human form, and was acknowledged
to be the most beautiful woman

<p class='c016'><i>White Lady</i> (<i>The</i>), a ghost seen in different
castles and palaces belonging to the
royal family of Prussia, and supposed to
forebode the death of some of the royal
family, especially one of the children.
The last appearance was in 1879, just prior
to the death of Prince Waldemar. Twice
she has been heard to speak, <em>e.g.</em>: In
December, 1628, she appeared in the palace
at Berlin, and said in Latin, “I wait
for judgment;” and once at the castle of
Neuhaus, in Bohemia, when she said to
the princess, in German, “It is ten o’clock;”
and the lady addressed died in a few
weeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two white ladies, in fact--one
the Countess Agnes, of Orlamunde, and
the other the Princess Bertha von Rosenberg,
who lived in the fifteenth century.
The former was buried alive in a vault in
the palace. She was the mistress of a
margrave of Brandenburgh, by whom she
had two sons. When the prince became a
widower, Agnes thought he would marry
her, but he made the sons an objection,
and she poisoned them, for which crime
she was buried alive. Another version
is that she fell in love with the prince of
Parma, and made away with her two
daughters, who were an obstacle to her
marriage, for which crime she was doomed
to “walk the earth” as an apparition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Princess Bertha is troubled because
an annual gift, which she left to the poor,
has been discontinued. She appears
dressed in white, and carrying at her side
a bunch of keys.</p>

<p class='c018'>It may interest those who happen to be learned
in Berlin legends, to know that the White
Lady, whose visits always precede the death
of some member of the royal family, was seen
on the eve of Prince Waldemar’s death. A
soldier on guard at the old castle was the witness
of the apparition, and in his fright fled to the
guard-room, where he was at once arrested for
deserting his post.--<cite>Brief</cite>, April 4, 1879.</p>

whom Jupiter had made keeper of the
winds, Æolus bound the storm-winds in
an ox’s bladder, and tied it in the ship

Then he sent the west wind to waft the

and commands Camillo to poison him;
but Camillo only warns Polixenês of the
danger, and flees with him to Bohemia.
When Leontês hears thereof, his rage is
unbounded; and he casts his queen, Hermi´onê,
into prison, where she gives birth
to a daughter, which Leontês gives direction
shall be placed on a desert shore
to perish. In the mean time, he is told
that Hermionê, the queen, is dead. The
vessel containing the infant daughter being
storm-driven to Bohemia, the child is left
there, and is brought up by a shepherd,
who calls it Perdĭta. One day, in a hunt,
Prince Florizel sees Perdita and falls in
love with her; but Polixenês, his father,
tells her that she and the shepherd shall
be put to death if she encourages the
foolish suit. Florizel and Perdita now
flee to Sicily, and being introduced to
Leontês, it is soon discovered that Perdita
is his lost daughter. Polixenês tracks his
son to Sicily, and being told of the discovery,
gladly consents to the union he
had before forbidden. Pauli´na now invites

Hermionê in her house, and the statue
turns out to be the living queen.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Wooden Horse</b> (<i>The</i>). Virgil tells us
that Ulysses had a monster wooden horse,
made by Epēos after the death of Hector,
and gave out that it was an offering to
the gods to secure a prosperous voyage
back to Greece. By the advice of Sinon,
the Trojans dragged the horse into Troy
for a palladium; but at night the Grecian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>soldiers concealed therein were released
by Sinon from their concealment, slew
the Trojan guards, opened the city gates,
and set fire to Troy. Arctīnos of Milētus,
in his poem called <cite>The Destruction of Troy</cite>,
furnished Virgil with the tale of “the
Wooden Horse” and “the burning of
Troy” (fl. <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 776).</p>

<p class='c001'>A remarkable parallel occurred in Saracenic
history. Arrestan, in Syria, was
taken in the seventh century by Abu Obeidah
by a similar stratagem. He obtained
leave of the governor to deposit in the
citadel some old lumber which impeded
his march. Twenty large boxes filled with
men were carried into the castle. Abu
marched off; and, while the Christians
were returning thanks for the departure
of the enemy, the soldiers removed the
sliding bottoms of the boxes and made
their way out, overpowered the sentries,
surprised the great church, opened the
city gates, and Abu, entering with his
army, took the city without further opposition.--Ockley,
<cite>History of the Saracens</cite>, i.
185 (1718).</p>

<p class='c001'>The capture of Sark affords another
parallel. Sark was in the hands of the
French. A Netherlander, with one ship,
asked permission to bury one of his crew
in the chapel. The French consented,
provided the crew came on shore wholly
unarmed. This was agreed to, but the
coffin was full of arms, and the crew soon
equipped themselves, overpowered the
French, and took the island.--Percy, <cite>Anecdotes</cite>,

<p class='c016'><b>World</b> (<i>End of the</i>). This ought to
have occurred, according to Cardinal
Nicolas de Cusa, in 1704. He demonstrates
it thus: The Deluge happened in
the thirty-fourth jubilee of fifty years
from the Creation (<span class='fss'>A.M.</span> 1700), and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the end of the world should properly
occur on the thirty-fourth <a id='corr262L.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='jublilee'>jubilee</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_262L.2'><ins class='correction' title='jublilee'>jubilee</ins></a></span> of the
Christian era, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1704. The four
grace years are added to compensate for
the blunder of chronologists respecting
the first year of grace.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most popular dates of modern times
for the end of the world, or what is practically
the same thing, the Millennium,
are the following:--1757, Swedenborg;
1836, Johann Albrecht Bengel, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Erklärte
Offenbarung</cite></span>; 1843, William Miller, of
America; 1866, Dr. John Cumming; 1881,
Mother Shipton.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was very generally believed in France,
Germany, etc., that the end of the world
would happen in the thousandth year
after Christ; and therefore much of the
land was left uncultivated, and a general
famine ensued. Luckily, it was not agreed
whether the thousand years should date
from the birth or the death of Christ, or
the desolation would have been much
greater. Many charters begin with these
words, <em>As the world is now drawing to its
close</em>. Kings and nobles gave up their
state: Robert of France, son of Hugh
Capet, entered the monastery of St. Denis;
and at Limoges, princes, nobles, and
knights proclaimed “God’s Truce,” and
solemnly bound themselves to abstain
from feuds, to keep the peace towards
each other, and to help the oppressed.--Hallam,
<cite>The Middle Ages</cite> (1818).</p>

<p class='c001'>Another hypothesis is this: As one day
with God equals a thousand years (<cite>Psalm</cite>
xc. 4), and God labored in creation six
days, therefore the world is to labor 6000
years, and then to rest. According to this
theory, the end of the world ought to
occur <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> 6000, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1996 (supposing the
world to have been created 4004 years
before the birth of Christ). This hypothesis,
which is widely accepted, is quite safe
for another century at least.</p>

and his sister, Clarissa, Blandford and
his daughter, Belinda. Sir John and
Lady Restless were wrong in suspecting
each other of infidelity, but this misunderstanding
made their lives wretched. Beverley
was deeply in love with Belinda, and
was wrong in his jealousy of her, but Belinda
was also wrong in not vindicating
herself. She knew that she was innocent,
and felt that Beverley ought to trust her,
but she gave herself and him needless torment
by permitting a misconception to
remain which she might have most easily
removed. The old men were also wrong:
Blandford in promising his daughter in
marriage to Sir William Bellmont’s son,
seeing she loved Beverley; and Sir William,
in accepting the promise, seeing his son
was plighted to Clarissa. A still further
complication of wrong occurs. Sir John
wrongs Beverley in believing him to be
intriguing with his wife; and Lady Restless
wrongs Belinda in supposing that she
coquets with her husband; both were pure
mistakes, all were in the wrong, but all in

constant attacks from the savages the
colony armed in self-defence. In 1778

Brittany he married the king’s daughter,
Ysolde or Ysonde <em>of the White Hand</em>, but
neither loved her nor lived with her. The
rest of the tale is differently told by different
authors. Some say he returned to
Cornwall, renewed his love with Ysolde
<em>the Fair</em>, and was treacherously stabbed
by his uncle Mark. Others say he was
severely wounded in Brittany, and sent
for his aunt, but died before her arrival.
When Ysolde <em>the Fair</em> heard of his death,
she died of a broken heart, and King
Mark buried them both in one grave,
over which he planted a rose bush and a
vine.</p>

Sir Tristram married her for her <em>name’s</em>

her, because he loved his aunt, Ysolde <em>the
Fair</em> (the young wife of King Mark), and
it was a point of chivalry for a knight
to love only one woman, whether widow,
wife, or maid.</p>

sister of Nerestan. Twenty years ago
Lusignan and his two children had been
taken captives. Nerestan was four years
old at the time; and Zara, a mere infant,
was brought up in the seraglio. Osman
the sultan fell in love with her, and promised
to make her his sultana; and as Zara
loved him for himself, her happiness
seemed complete. Nerestan, having been
sent to France to obtain ransoms, returned
at this crisis, and Osman fancied that he
observed a familiarity between Zara and
Nerestan, which roused his suspicions.
Several things occurred to confirm them,
and at last a letter was intercepted, appointing
a rendezvous between them in a
“secret passage” of the seraglio. Osman
met Zara in the passage, and stabbed her
to the heart. Nerestan was soon seized,
and being brought before the sultan, told
him he had slain his sister, and the sole
object of his interview was to inform her
of her father’s death, and to bring her his
dying blessing. Osman now saw his error,
commanded all the Christian captives to
be set at liberty, and stabbed himself.</p>

Zesbet was the mother of the Prophet

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
